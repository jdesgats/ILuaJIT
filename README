ILuaJIT - Readline powered shell for LuaJIT

This project is just at early stages of it's development. 
It's nowhere near finished or stable or documented or anything !

This script provides a shell with readline integration to LuaJIT. It uses a 
adapted version lua-rlcompleter[1] for completion engine and a pure Lua binding
for readline (thanks to LuaJIT FFI).

It is also intended to ease interaction with Lua a bit like IPython for Python
with features such as:
  * History (not persistant yet)
  * Improved error handling (shows the code which caused error)
  * Anything else you could imagine ! (any contribution is welcome)



Usage

You need at least LuaJIT 2.0 beta 9 [1] and libreadline installed on your system.
Optionally, if lfs is present in youy Lua PATH, it will be used to complete file
names inside strings.

To run the shell, start just `iluajit.lua` (e.g. `luajit iluajit.lua`).
Currently, it has been tested only unde Linux, but should work on any system 
with readline.

An extra global variable `shell` is available to customize nearly any aspect of
the shell (not yet documented, see shell.lua)
